		<h5>What is Nanotechnology?</h5>
		<p>Nanotechnology is science, engineering, and technology conducted at the nanoscale, which is about 1 to 100 nanometers.Nanoscience and nanotechnology are the study and application of extremely small things and can be used across all the other science fields, such as chemistry, biology, physics, materials science, and engineering.

<h5 >Fundamental Concepts in Nanotechnology</h5>
<p>It’s hard to imagine just how small nanotechnology is. One nanometer is a billionth of a meter, or 10-9 of a meter. Here are a few illustrative examples:</p>
<li>There are 25,400,000 nanometers in an inch</li>
<li>A sheet of newspaper is about 100,000 nanometers thick</li>
<li>On a comparative scale, if a marble were a nanometer, then one meter would be the size of the Earth</li>
<p>Nanoscience and nanotechnology involve the ability to see and to control individual atoms and molecules. Everything on Earth is made up of atoms—the food we eat, the clothes we wear, the buildings and houses we live in, and our own bodies.

But something as small as an atom is impossible to see with the naked eye. In fact, it’s impossible to see with the microscopes typically used in a high school science classes. The microscopes needed to see things at the nanoscale were invented in the early 1980s.

Once scientists had the right tools, such as the scanning tunneling microscope (STM) and the atomic force microscope (AFM), the age of nanotechnology was born.

Although modern nanoscience and nanotechnology are quite new, nanoscale materials were used for centuries. Alternate-sized gold and silver particles created colors in the stained glass windows of medieval churches hundreds of years ago. The artists back then just didn’t know that the process they used to create these beautiful works of art actually led to changes in the composition of the materials they were working with.

Today's scientists and engineers are finding a wide variety of ways to deliberately make materials at the nanoscale to take advantage of their enhanced properties such as higher strength, lighter weight, increased control of light spectrum, and greater chemical reactivity than their larger-scale counterparts.</p>

	<h5>Nanotech Engineering</h5>
	<p>As nanotechnology engineering evolves, it will continue to transform how scientists research and produce new materials at the molecular level. In the future, researchers expect products that use nanotechnology to drive advancements in areas such as sustainability, medicine, and robotics. For example, scientists can use nanotechnology engineering to create drugs that target specific cells in the body or build materials that can grow artificial organs. Nanotechnology can also be used to improve sustainability and access to natural resources with inventions such as molecular water filtration and self-cleaning materials.
Second, we can clean up air pollution, including greenhouse gases, with nanotech catalysts that remove carbon dioxide from the air and reconfigure it into chemicals we can use in the industry.

<h5>Mechatronics</h5>
<p>Mechatronics is a multidisciplinary field that refers to the skill sets needed in the contemporary, advanced automated manufacturing industry. At the intersection of mechanics, electronics, and computing, mechatronics specialists create simpler, smarter systems. Mechatronics is an essential foundation for the expected growth in automation and manufacturing.
	Mechatronics specialists can do quite a bit across multiple disciplines and have a solid base from which to grow. Mechatronics specialists know both mechanical and electrical engineering fundamentals—they speak both languages—so a mechatronics specialist can work with both mechanical and engineering teams.

<h5 style="text-align:center;">MICRO & NANO MECHATRONICS</h5>
	<p>Via the study of the behavior of materials and devices at micro and nano-scales, the Micro & Nano Mechatronics research group designs solutions around the unequalled opportunities offered at those scales. The research opportunities are boundless, ranging from scientific research into theoretical foundations for the behavior of materials to devising micro and nano fabrication techniques and finally device design and characterization.

The application areas of micro and nano mechatronics include basic applications in robotics, sensors, actuators, semiconductor materials and devices, automobiles, portable electronic devices, and displays. Our goals in the design of materials, devices or systems are a combination of improving performance, miniaturization, lowering power consumption, reducing cost and waste and making flexible transducers and electronics.

Our research group has direct access to state-of-the-art facilities for fabrication and characterization of micro and nano devices. We closely collaborate with industrial partners and other research teams across the campus, the country and internationally. At the centre of our research are graduate students and other researchers who gain expertise in industrial needs and cutting-edge research and development challenges.
